    <p>My Background
      ***My Background***

      With a background in journalism, I’ve always been captivated by stories. As a journalism major, and an intern at the Worcester Telegram & Gazette I learned to conduct research, ask compelling questions, and construct narratives from the view of the interviewee.

      The love of this investigative process is part of what led me to UX design. Most people spend a huge portion of their lives on their computers and mobile devices. I want to understand how users interact with web apps and what leads them to make decisions.

      In addition to a background in journalism, I also have experience in marketing. I currently work as a Marketing Assistant for a company that provides wholistic consultations for wellness businesses.

      We always look at the whole picture since a successful web presence is more than just a pretty design, or creating ads to drive traffic. You don’t want to focus on advertisements if you don’t have a conversion optimized landing page to send people to.

      It was in marketing that I learned the importance of crafting user personas for your target audience and understanding not only how they will interact with your product or service, but what motivates them to do so in the first place. This is another area that has cross over with good UX design.

      I find marketing to be extremely rewarding because you’re constantly asking yourself —

      How can I provide the most value?

      How can I get the biggest ROI for my client?

      These are the types of questions that really drive me in my work, which is why I see myself working in a sphere where UX and marketing combine.




      ***Plans for the Future***

      To learn more about UX, I enrolled in a design program at Bloc, where I’ve learned to research, design, and build for modern web applications.

      Under the guidance of my mentor, Joey Kirk, I’ve spent time problem solving, refactoring code, and constantly refining my designs through critique.

      I’m looking forward to applying what I’ve learned to future projects.

      As a life-long-learner I also look forward to continuing my education. </p>
