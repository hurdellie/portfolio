  <h1>Paycrave: A Case Study</h1>

  <p>For this project, Bloc.io presented me with a logo and color palette and gave me the challenge of designing a mobile app that allows users to find food trucks near them, view a menu, select items for purchase and checkout.</p>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>Tools for finding food trucks are extremely limited. You’re almost exclusively limited to going to the food truck website for directions. There’s no way to filter out a map of food trucks based on what you’re feeling like eating and what’s nearby, and there’s no way to pay in advance to avoid long lines. This combination of challenges can make ordering from food trucks a frustrating and lengthy experience. </p>

  <h2>The Solution</h2>

  <p>Using a location-based map and intuitive filters, PayCrave makes it easy to find the food you’re craving. It also employs an easy-to-navigate menu/payment system so that you can easily find and pay for food before you arrive. </p>

  <h2>The Process</h2>
